# Answering the questions

# Data

```{r}
# reading the data and converting categorical features to factor
exp_imp <- read_csv("data/data_comexstat.csv") %>% mutate_if(is.character, as_factor)

skim(exp_imp)
```

Note that the data have no missing values and are composed of 5 variables of type factor, 2 numerics and one being date. There are 117,965 observations that cover the period from 1997 to 2019.

## Dictionary of Data

- date: date where occurred the transaction.
- product: commodities (soybean, soybeans meal, soybean oil, wheat and sugar).
- state: State responsible for the transaction.
- type: if there is exportation or importation.
- route: route used to transport the commodity.
- tons: quantity export/import.
- usd: commercial currency.

For each question, the answer will contain an chunk of code and an explanation.

**1 - Show the evolution of total monthly and total annual exports from Brazil (all states and to everywhere) of ‘soybeans’, ‘soybean oil’ and ‘soybean meal’;**

```{r}
# adding two columns: year and month
exp_imp_year_month_tbl <- exp_imp %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date),
         month = month(date, abbr = FALSE, label = TRUE))

# total of tons of the specific commodities.
expt_states_grouped_year_total_tbl <- exp_imp_year_month_tbl %>%
  filter(type == "Export") %>% 
  filter(product %in% c("soybeans", "soybean_oil", "soybean_meal")) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(total_tons = sum(tons)) %>% 
  ungroup()

# total of tons for each month of the year (the same commodities)
exp_imp_year_month_total_tbl <- exp_imp_year_month_tbl %>% 
  filter(type == "Export") %>% 
  filter(product %in% c("soybeans", "soybean_oil", "soybean_meal")) %>%

  ungroup()

# Visualizations ORDENARRRRRRR

    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista"
  )

```

On the monthly chart, when comparing the same months over the years, we see that there is a more pronounced growth trend in the months from March to July.

See also that, over the years, as Brazil's exports follow a growing trend, even if there is a drop in 2019, it is likely to grow again.

**2 - What are the 3 most important products exported by Brazil in the last 5 years?**

```{r}
# filtering for specific years and type
# total of tuns for these groups
top_3_product_exp_tbl <- exp_imp_year_month_tbl %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2019:2015)) %>% 
  filter(type == "Export") %>% 
  group_by(product) %>% 
  summarise(total_tons_exp = sum(tons)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  slice_max(total_tons_exp, n = 3)

top_3_product_exp_tbl %>% 
  mutate(product_str = case_when(
    product == "soybeans" ~ "Soybeans",
    product == "corn" ~ "Corn",
    TRUE ~ "Sugar"
  )) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_tons_exp,
             y = fct_reorder(product_str, total_tons_exp),
             fill = product_str)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#7EBEF7", "#2595F5", "#BBD7F0")) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +

    title = "Top 3 - Brazilian Commodities Exports",
    subtitle = "Considering the Last 5 Years",
    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista",
    x = "Millions of Tons",
    y = "Commodities"
  )

glimpse(top_3_product_exp_tbl)
```

See that the top 3 products that are most exported in Brazil are: Soybeans, Corn and Sugar. With the more important being soybeans.

**3 - What are the main routes through which Brazil have been exporting ‘corn’ in the last few years? Are there differences in the relative importance of routes depending on the product?**

```{r}
# We see that the sea is the most important route of exportation considering all commodities
tops_routes_exp <- exp_imp_year_month_tbl %>% 
  filter(type == "Export") %>% 
  filter(year > 2000) %>% # selecting most recent years
  count(route) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

# The same happened for Corn
tops_routes_corn_exp <- exp_imp_year_month_tbl %>% 
  filter(product == "corn") %>% 
  filter(type == "Export") %>% 
  filter(year > 2000) %>% # selecting most recent years

tops_routes_corn_exp %>%

             y = fct_reorder(route, prop),
             fill = route)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100, suffix = "%")) +

    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista",
    x = "Proportions",
    y = "Exportation Routes"
  ) +
  guides(fill = F)

```


```{r}
exp_by_route_product_tbl <- exp_imp_year_month_tbl %>% 
  mutate(product = case_when(
    product == "corn" ~ "Corn",
    product == "soybean_meal" ~ "Soybeans Meal",
    product == "soybean_oil" ~ "Soybean Oil",
    product == "sugar" ~ "Sugar",
    product == "soybeans" ~ "Soybeans",
    TRUE ~ "Wheat"
  )) %>% 
  filter(type == "Export") %>% 
  group_by(route, product) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop_by_route = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup()

exp_by_route_product_tbl %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tidytext::reorder_within(product, prop_by_route, route),
             y = prop_by_route)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = prop_by_route)) +

    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista",
    y = "",
    x = "Commodities"
  ) +
  theme_tq() +
  labs(fill = "Proportion by Routes")

```

Although most products are transported by sea, we observe that depending on the route there is a preference for the product that will be exported.

As the three main products exported in each route we have:
- Sea: sugar, soybeans and soybeans meal.
- Ground: soybean oil, sugar and corn.
- Air: corn (much more), soybeans and sugar.
- Other: sugar, soybean oil and corn.
- River: soybeans, corn and sugar.

**4 - Which countries have been the most important trade partners for Brazil in terms of ‘corn’ and ‘sugar’ in the last 3 years?**

```{r}

Brazil's main partners alternate between India, Algeria, Iran, Egypt and Bangladesh.

Looking at imports, we see that there are far fewer partners and among them, the main ones are Paraguay, Argentina and the United States.

**5 - For each of the products in the dataset, show the 5 most important states in terms of exports?** 

```{r}
quest_5_tbl <- exp_imp %>% 
  filter(type == "Export") %>%

**Question:** What should be the total brazilian *soybeans*, *soybean_meal*, and *corn* export forecasts, in tons, for the **next 11 years** (2020-2030)? We’re mostly interested in the **annual forecast**.

For the modeling phase, only the total quantities produced in each month/year for each product of interest will be considered. Then, the data table will be summarized in three variables:

- product
- date
- total of tons

Then, 3 new data tables will be created with one time series of each product to make a forecast.

```{r}
glimpse(exp_imp)

# ts_br_bl contains all the commodities
ts_br_tbl <- exp_imp %>% 
  group_by(product, date) %>% 
  summarise(total_tons = sum(tons)) %>% 
  ungroup()

ts_br_soybeans_tbl <- ts_br_tbl %>%
  filter(product == "soybeans")

ts_br_soybeans_meal_tbl <- ts_br_tbl %>%
  filter(product == "soybean_meal")

ts_br_corn_tbl <- ts_br_tbl  %>%
  filter(product == "corn")

ts_br_corn_tbl %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = total_tons)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  theme_tq() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Total of Tons",
       title = "Time Series for Corn",
       caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista")

ts_br_soybeans_tbl %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = total_tons)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  theme_tq() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Total of Tons",
       title = "Time Series for Soybean",
       caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista")

ts_br_soybeans_meal_tbl %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = total_tons)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  theme_tq() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Total of Tons",
       title = "Time Series for Soybeans Meal",
       caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista")

```

## Seasonality

Now, with all the data transformed, it is possible to investigate the behavior of each series and then show two types of graphs to detect seasonality.

### Corn

```{r}
ts_br_corn_tbl %>% 
  plot_seasonal_diagnostics(date, total_tons, .interactive = F) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  labs(
    title = "Seasonal Diagnostics for Corn",
    y = "Millions of Tons",
    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista"
  )

ts_br_corn_tbl %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date) %>% as_factor(),
         month = month(date) %>% as_factor()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = month,
             fill = total_tons )) +
  scale_fill_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  geom_tile(color = "grey40") +
  labs(
    title = "Totals of Exportation of Corn Across the Years and Months",
    y = "Months",
    x = "",
    fill = "Millions of\nTons",
    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista"
  )
  
  
```

Looking at the seasonal diagnosis, we see that in the last few months there has been an increase in corn exportation. A second analysis is that we see an upward trend in these products over the years, this observation can also be seen when viewing the heat map, where the lighter periods are displayed larger.

### Soybeans

```{r}
ts_br_soybeans_tbl %>% 
  plot_seasonal_diagnostics(date, total_tons, .interactive = F) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  labs(
    title = "Seasonal Diagnostics for Soybeans",
    y = "Millions of Tons",
    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista"
  )

ts_br_soybeans_tbl %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date) %>% as_factor(),
         month = month(date) %>% as_factor()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = month,
             fill = total_tons)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  geom_tile(color = "grey40") +
  labs(
    title = "Totals of Exportation of Soybeans Across the Years and Months",
    y = "Months",
    x = "",
    fill = "Millions of\nTons",
    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista"
  )
```

Soya, on the other hand, presents a seasonality of exports between March and July. It also has an increasing tendency to increase over the years. When looking at the heatmap, it is possible to see both periods of greater export and an increase over the years.

### Soybeans Meal

```{r}
ts_br_soybeans_meal_tbl %>% 
  plot_seasonal_diagnostics(date, total_tons, .interactive = F) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  labs(
    title = "Seasonal Diagnostics for Soybeans Meal",
    y = "Millions of Tons",
    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista"
  )

ts_br_soybeans_meal_tbl %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date) %>% as_factor(),
         month = month(date) %>% as_factor()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = month,
             fill = total_tons)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  geom_tile(color = "grey40") +
  labs(
    title = "Totals of Exportation of Soybeans Meal Across the Years and Months",
    y = "Months",
    x = "",
    fill = "Millions of\nTons",
    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista"
  )
```

The data for the soybean meal show a more stationary trend, with not much exported evolution, neither over the months nor over the years.

# Forecasting

As before, our series have different formats, so, we will use a diversity of models, and right after investigating which model had the best result.

Will be applied:
- auto-arima
- prophet
- random forest
- prophet boost

## Corn production for the next 11 years

```{r}
# seeing the trend
ts_br_corn_tbl %>% 
  plot_time_series(date, total_tons, .interactive = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(scale = 1e-6, suffix = "M")) +
  labs(
    title = "Time Series Trend for Corn",
    y = "Millions of Tons",
    caption = "github.com/LucianoBatista"
  )

# train/test
# assess it's the parameter for quantity of test months
# cumulative TRUE assume that the rest of the data goes to train
splits <- ts_br_corn_tbl %>% 
  time_series_split(assess = "48 months", cumulative = TRUE)

# setting seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# visualizing train and test
splits %>%
  tk_time_series_cv_plan() %>% 
  plot_time_series_cv_plan(date, total_tons, .interactive = T)
  
# MODELS ----
## auto arima
model_fit_arima <- arima_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("auto_arima") %>% 
  fit(total_tons ~ date, training(splits))

## prophet
model_fit_prophet <- prophet_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("prophet", yearly.seasonality = TRUE) %>% # yearly seasonality (heatmap)
  fit(total_tons ~ date, training(splits))

```


To use more complex models, we need to pre-process the data. To do this, we are using the recipe package and applying the following steps:
- step_timeseries_signature: doing 25 more features descending of the date feature.
- step_rm: remove features.
- step_fourier: decompose the temporal signal into frequency.
- step_dummy: conversion of categorical to numeric features.

```{r}
# recipe for preprocessing
recipe_spec <- recipe(total_tons ~ date, training(splits)) %>% 
  step_timeseries_signature(date) %>% 
  step_rm(contains("am.pm"), contains("hour"), contains("minute"),
          contains("second"), contains("xts"), contains("day"), contains("week")) %>% 
  step_fourier(date, period = 365, K = 5) %>% # tune K
  step_dummy(all_nominal())

recipe_spec %>% prep() %>% juice()

# random forest
model_spec_rf <- rand_forest(trees = 500, min_n = 50) %>% 
  set_engine("randomForest")

# pulling all together: model + preprocessing and workflow
workflow_fit_rf <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(model_spec_rf) %>% 
  add_recipe(recipe_spec %>% step_rm(date)) %>% 
  fit(training(splits))

# prophet boost
model_spec_prophet_boost <- prophet_boost() %>% 
  set_engine("prophet_xgboost", yearly.seasonality = TRUE)

workflow_fit_prophet_boost <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(model_spec_prophet_boost) %>%
  add_recipe(recipe_spec) %>%
  fit(training(splits))

```

Now that our models are trained, we will evaluate their performance on the test data, using the ModelTime package for that.

```{r}
model_table <- modeltime_table(
  model_fit_arima,
  model_fit_prophet,
  workflow_fit_rf,
  workflow_fit_prophet_boost
)

# calibration
# model error
calibration_table <- model_table %>%
  modeltime_calibrate(testing(splits))

calibration_table

calibration_table %>%
  modeltime_forecast(actual_data = ts_br_corn_tbl) %>%
  plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = FALSE)

calibration_table %>%
  modeltime_accuracy() %>%
  table_modeltime_accuracy(.interactive = FALSE)

```

The metric SMAPE (symmetric mean absolute proportional error) will be evaluated, as it is a common metric used in some forecasting works.

Therefore, the ARIMA model performed better.

```{r}
predictions <- calibration_table %>%
  # Remove models with low accuracy
  filter(!.model_id %in% c(4, 3)) %>%
  # Refit and Forecast Forward
  modeltime_refit(ts_br_corn_tbl) %>%
  modeltime_forecast(h = "132 months", actual_data = ts_br_corn_tbl)

predictions %>% 
  plot_modeltime_forecast(.interactive = TRUE)
```


```{r}
predict_by_year_model_corn <- predictions %>% 
  mutate(year = year(.index)) %>% 
  drop_na(.model_id) %>% 
  group_by(year, .model_id) %>% 
  summarise(total_predict = sum(.value))

predict_by_year_model_corn %>% 
  mutate(model_id = .model_id %>% as_factor()) %>% 
  mutate(model_id = case_when(
    .model_id == 1 ~ "Arima",
    .model_id == 2 ~ "Prophet"
  )) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model_id,

The metric SMAPE (symmetric mean absolute proportional error) will be evaluated, as it is a common metric used in some forecasting works.

Therefore, the Prophet w/ xgboost model performed better.

  # Refit and Forecast Forward
  modeltime_refit(ts_br_soybeans_meal_tbl) %>%

```{r}
predict_by_year_model_soybeans_meal <- predictions %>% 
  mutate(year = year(.index)) %>% 
  drop_na(.model_id) %>% 
  group_by(year, .model_id) %>% 
  summarise(total_predict = sum(.value))

predict_by_year_model_soybeans_meal %>% 
  mutate(model_id = .model_id %>% as_factor()) %>% 
  mutate(model_id = case_when(
    .model_id == 2 ~ "Prophet",
    .model_id == 4 ~ "Prophet\nw/ Xgboost"
  )) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model_id,
             y = total_predict,
             fill = model_id)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#4975D6", "deepskyblue4", "#21418A", "#238391")) +

```

So, the objects `predict_by_year_model_soybeans_meal` `predict_by_year_model_soybean` `predict_by_year_model_corn` contains all the predictions. For one next phase, these models could be tuning and other pre-processing steps could be applied. Also is interesting that across the next years these models could be retrained to better improve the forecasting.
